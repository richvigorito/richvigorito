# 👋 Hi, I’m Rich Vigorito

**Staff Software Architect** & **Lead Backend Engineer** in Portland, OR.  
I design and deliver reliable, secure, event-driven backend systems — from load balancer to database.

---

## 🧠 About Me

I’ve spent 20+ years building systems from the ground up:
- Architected full backend stacks: HAProxy, nginx, Linux, MySQL, Redis, REST APIs, Event Driven Systems
- Designed resilient data models, security layers, caching schemes, scaling patterns
- Led teams, mentored devs, and cultivated strong documentation and onboarding
- Love writing tools, games, and utilities to strengthen dev team culture
- Partner closely with IT, product owners, stakeholders, and execs to deliver aligned outcomes  
- Most recent company, an early stage startup, brought product to market.

Industry domains I’ve worked in:
- **SupplyStream** – logistics, warehouse packaging supplies, pricing mgmt and e-commerce
- **Oregon Catholic Press** – book and music publishing, royalties mgmt, lit planning apps, e-commerce
- **Inspiredware** – student/teacher scheduling and location software

All involved deep system integrations and cross-team collaboration.

Personal projects I'm currently leaning into **Python**, **Go**, and **language tech** (ASR/NLP)
